# landing-page

For this project I've built an entire web page from a design photo that The Odin Project crew provided. 

The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

All of the images used are free to use under the Pixabay and Unsplash licenses and credited where it was possible.
